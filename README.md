# Command Vault

A [Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/) plugin that works like a 1Password-style command launcher.

Press your hotkey, type a keyword, and instantly find and copy commands for Cisco IOS, Linux, Proxmox, and Ansible — with full-text search, favorites, template variable support, and a built-in GUI manager.

## Features

- **Structured library** — commands organized by category and subcategory (Cisco › VLAN, Linux › SSH, Proxmox › Cluster, Ansible › Playbook, …)
- **Full-text search** — FTS5 searches title, command, description, and tags simultaneously
- **Favorites** — star frequently used commands, they appear first when the query is empty
- **Template variables** — commands like `show interfaces {iface}` prompt for values before copying
- **Copy on Enter** — command lands in clipboard immediately
- **GUI Manager** — built-in editor to add, edit, duplicate and delete commands (`cv :manage`)
- **Context menu** — toggle favorite, copy, open vault folder
- **SQLite backend** — fully editable database, version-controllable, no cloud dependency
- **156 built-in commands** across Cisco, Linux, Proxmox and Ansible

## Requirements

- [Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/) 1.17+
- Python 3.10+ — install via:
  ```
  winget install Python.Python.3.12 --source winget
  ```

## Installation

### From GitHub Release (recommended)

1. Download `CommandVault-1.1.1.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/BossFlap/flow-command-vault/releases)
2. Extract the folder to `%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher\Plugins\`
3. Open a terminal inside the extracted folder and run:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Restart Flow Launcher
5. Type `cv :init` in Flow Launcher and press **Enter** to create the database and load all built-in commands

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BossFlap/flow-command-vault
cd flow-command-vault

xcopy /E /I . "%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher\Plugins\CommandVault-1.1.1"
cd "%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher\Plugins\CommandVault-1.1.1"

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then restart Flow Launcher and type `cv :init` to initialize the database.

## Usage

| Query | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `cv :init` | Initialize the database and load all built-in commands |
| `cv` | Shows all favorites first |
| `cv vlan` | All VLAN-related commands |
| `cv cisco trunk` | Cisco trunk commands |
| `cv show mac` | Any command matching "show mac" |
| `cv proxmox ceph` | Ceph-related Proxmox commands |
| `cv ansible check` | Ansible dry-run commands |
| `cv :manage` | Open the GUI manager |

**Enter** → copies command to clipboard
**Ctrl+O** → context menu (favorite, copy, open folder)

### Template variables

Commands containing `{variable}` will prompt for input before copying:

```
show interfaces {iface}
→ prompts: "Value for iface"
→ copies:  show interfaces Gi1/0/1
```

### GUI Manager

Type `cv :manage` in Flow Launcher to open the built-in editor:

- Add, edit, duplicate and delete commands
- Search and filter by category
- Toggle favorites
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+N` add, `Enter` edit, `Del` delete

## Built-in categories

| Category | Subcategories | Commands |
|----------|---------------|----------|

## Adding your own commands

```
